Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks at a meeting with members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held on Monday and Tuesday.
The priority for all members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee is to implement the tasks and realize the goals set at the 19th CPC National Congress, Xi said at the meeting.
"Words are not enough while actual actions are needed. Holding meetings and handing out papers are not enough while actual implementation is needed," he said.
Whether or not to fully implement the policies is a major indicator of loyalty and competence of a leading official, he stressed.
He urged leading officials to understand their duty, identify flaws and weaknesses and work out proper solutions.
Officials in charge should take responsibility, he said, adding that they should be brave to deal with the hardest issues and be competent enough to solve the most difficult problems.
Emphasizing the importance of the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership, Xi urged members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to regard it as a political benchmark.
They should highly identify with, firmly safeguard, willingly obey and closely follow the leadership of CPC Central Committee in terms of "political stance, direction, principle and path," he said.
Warning of barriers and risks ahead as well as profound changes in Chinese society and abroad, Xi noted that requirements for Party's governance and leadership have changed and leading officials should have a stronger sense of urgency and be ready for "a great struggle with many new contemporary features."
